# Codecept Skeleton

A thin setup to quickly write codecept tests.

## Usage

```sh 
npm install or yarn install
```

Write your tests in `tests` folder with the name `*.test.js`

Run your tests:

```sh
npm start or yarn start
```

Additional (debug) output:

```sh
npm run verbose or yarn verbose
```

## Configuration

Edit the `codecept.conf.js`.

## Example

Have a look at `tests/wiki.test.js`
